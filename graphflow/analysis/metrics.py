    where `d(v, u)` is the shortest-path distance between `v` and `u`,
    and `n` is the number of nodes that can reach `u`. Notice that the
    closeness distance function computes the incoming distance to `u`
    for directed graphs. To use outward distance, act on `G.reverse()`.

    Notice that higher values of closeness indicate higher centrality.

    Wasserman and Faust propose an improved formula for graphs with
    more than one connected component. The result is "a ratio of the
    fraction of actors in the group who are reachable, to the average
    distance" from the reachable actors [2]_. You might think this
